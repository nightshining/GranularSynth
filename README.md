# Max + Max4Live Granular Synthesis 


* Drag and drop wav file onto the waveform display on the center bottom. 

* There is a function that indefinitely runs grains at variable rate intervals, selectable by clicking the 'Constant' tab on the top left.

* Additionally there is a function to playback the grains in a linear rate by clicking 'Linear' tab on the top left. This function let's you specify the speed to playback the individual grains, as well as the size of each. 

* The synth is based on the tutorials of Peter Batchelor(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1N7aXQb56w) which I highly recommend for learning more about Max programming and digital synthesis techniques.
